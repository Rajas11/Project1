                <h2>Happiness is Watching Your Plants Grow</h2>
                <p>Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic.
                   This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis
                   with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water,using the green pigment chlorophyll.
                   Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for chlorophyll and photosynthesis, 
                   and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants are multicellular, except for some green algae.
                   Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals,
                   and included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then;
                   current definitions exclude the fungi and some of the algae.
                   By the definition used in this article, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green plants).</p>
